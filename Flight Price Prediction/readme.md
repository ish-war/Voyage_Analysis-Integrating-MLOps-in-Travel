## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to build an automated pipeline for Flight Price Prediction using Apache Airflow. The pipeline handles data ingestion, transformation, and machine learning model training with RandomForestRegressor. The project is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Apache Airflow, making it scalable and efficient for continuous workflow automation.

## Features

* Automated Workflow: Uses Apache Airflow DAGs for scheduling and automation.

* Data Pipeline: Extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) flight data.

* Machine Learning Model: Trains a RandomForestRegressor for price prediction.

* Dockerized Deployment: Fully containerized using Docker Compose.

* Task Orchestration: Ensures streamlined execution with task dependencies.

* Modular Codebase: Organized structure with separate modules for ingestion, transformation, and model training.
